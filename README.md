# Resize-Picture
A small program to resize pictures for office employees. It has a folder to recieve the photos that will be re-sized and then asks
the user to give a destination and folder name for the photos to be resized and sent to with the originals. The program creates the destination folder 
located on the users dirpath and resizes and move pics.
